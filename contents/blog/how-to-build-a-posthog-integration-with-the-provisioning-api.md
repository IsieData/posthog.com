---

I recently built a [website](https://creeksidefields.com/) to sell shares of hogs. I realized it's too difficult for my fellow farmers, who are better versed in the subtle arts of managing soil, plants, and animals than the [latest coding tool](https://posthog.com/code), to build similar sites with current tech. So, I threw together a website builder for farmers.

One of the most important aspects of distributing product from a farm is knowing who you're selling to. So, naturally, wiring up PostHog for product analytics, session replay, and error reporting was a no brainer. However, farmers are trying to farm not sign up for accounts and copy paste API keys into their farm builder apps. So, my farm website builder needed to provision PostHog accounts behind the scenes and surface insights directly to farmers. 

The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/Brooker-Fam/hogfarm) and there's a [live version](https://hogfarm-guava-tri.vercel.app) you can click around. Here's how I built it.

## Registering your OAuth client via CIMD

To register my OAuth client, I added a small JSON file. The first time I called the API, PostHog fetched the file and registered my OAuth app. It's called a [Client ID Metadata Document](/docs/api/oauth#client-id-metadata-document-cimd), or CIMD.

It looks like this:

```json
{
  "client_id": "https://hogfarm-guava-tri.vercel.app/.well-known/posthog-client.json",
  "client_name": "HogFarm",
  "redirect_uris": ["https://hogfarm-guava-tri.vercel.app/api/oauth/callback"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none",
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "com.posthog": {
    "scopes": ["query:read", "endpoint:write", "session_recording:read", "sharing_configuration:write", "insight:read", "project:read", "project:write", "person:read"]
  }
}
```

The `client_id` has to be the exact URL the file is served from, or it won't register. The `com.posthog.scopes` list is a ceiling: tokens can never go above it, whatever an individual request asks for. These scopes are everything the dashboard needs later: reading the analytics back and embedding a session recording. More on both below.

Because HogFarm holds no secret (`token_endpoint_auth_method` is `"none"`), I use PKCE to prove the token exchange. I generate a random verifier and send only its SHA-256 hash with the first call. The verifier gets replayed at token exchange.

```ts
const verifier = base64url(randomBytes(32))
const challenge = base64url(sha256(verifier))
```

## Creating the account

```ts
await fetch(`${HOST}/api/agentic/provisioning/account_requests`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "API-Version": "0.1d", "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    email,
    name,
    client_id: clientId,
    code_challenge: challenge,
    code_challenge_method: "S256",
    scopes: ["query:read", "endpoint:write", "session_recording:read", "sharing_configuration:write", "insight:read", "project:read", "project:write", "person:read"],
    configuration: { region: "US", organization_name: farmName },
  }),
})
```

There are a few cases to handle for this response:

- **A new email** comes back as `{ type: "oauth", code }`. The account gets created and linked quietly, I get a code on the spot, and the farmer gets a welcome email to set their password.
- **An email that's already a PostHog user** comes back as `{ type: "requires_auth", url }`. They have to consent in the browser first, so I send them to `url` and PostHog redirects back to my `redirect_uri` with a code.
- **The very first call from a new CIMD client** comes back as a `202` with `{ type: "registering" }`. PostHog fetches the metadata document in the background, so I wait the `retry_after` seconds and call again. This happens once per deployment, and it caught me off guard the first time (see below).

## Getting the project key

I swap the code for tokens:

```ts
await fetch(`${HOST}/api/agentic/oauth/token`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "API-Version": "0.1d", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
  body: new URLSearchParams({ grant_type: "authorization_code", code, code_verifier: verifier }),
})
```

The next call provisions a project:

```ts
await fetch(`${HOST}/api/agentic/provisioning/resources`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "API-Version": "0.1d",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    service_id: "free",
    label_prefix: farmName,
    configuration: { project_name: `${farmName} site` },
  }),
})
```

The response carries `complete.access_configuration.api_key` (the `phc_` token) and `host`. That key goes into the farm site HogFarm generates, so visits start landing in PostHog right away. `service_id: "free"` gives a free-tier project with no card required, which is all HogFarm needs.

## Reading the data back

Now for the fun part, giving critical business insights directly to the farmers. I could fire ad-hoc HogQL at the project on every dashboard load, but PostHog points you at [Endpoints](/docs/endpoints) instead: named, saved queries the project owns and you call by name. So when a project is provisioned I publish the dashboard's queries once, with `endpoint:write`:

```ts
await fetch(`${HOST}/api/projects/${teamId}/endpoints/`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "hogfarm_pageview_trend",
    query: {
      kind: "HogQLQuery",
      query: `SELECT toDate(timestamp), count() FROM events
              WHERE event = '$pageview' AND timestamp > now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
              GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1`,
    },
    data_freshness_seconds: 3600,
  }),
})
```

Then the dashboard runs them by name:

```ts
await fetch(`${HOST}/api/projects/${teamId}/endpoints/hogfarm_pageview_trend/run/?version=1`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: "{}",
})
```

That one builds the seven-day trend chart, two more get unique visitors and top pages. I pin `?version=1` so editing a query later can't quietly change a live farm's numbers. I leave them unmaterialized and read live: a freshly materialized endpoint serves empty until its first background refresh, which is the wrong default for a dashboard that has to look right the moment it loads.

Access tokens last an hour, so for anything long-lived you're storing the refresh token. Encrypt it. I keep them in Postgres with AES-256-GCM and a key that only lives in the environment, never in the database.

## Session replay, mostly for free

The farm site loads the PostHog snippet with session recording turned on, but that alone records nothing: a brand-new project is opted out at the project level, and the client-side switch can't override it. So at provision time I flip it on with `project:write`:

```ts
await fetch(`${HOST}/api/projects/${teamId}/`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ session_recording_opt_in: true }),
})
```

Now every visit records. On the dashboard I play the most recent one inline. The provisioning token also has `sharing_configuration:write`, so I flip on public sharing for the latest recording and get an embed token back:

```ts
const res = await fetch(
  `${HOST}/api/projects/${teamId}/session_recordings/${recordingId}/sharing/`,
  {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ enabled: true }),
  },
)
const { access_token } = await res.json()
// /embedded is the one PostHog page built to be iframed
const embedUrl = `https://us.posthog.com/embedded/${access_token}`
```

I drop that URL in an iframe and the farmer watches real visitors move through their site. The recording lives in their own project; HogFarm just borrows a public view of the latest one. (A shared recording is viewable by anyone with the link, which is fine for a demo, but a real builder would gate or expire it.)

## The stuff that bit me

These are the things that weren't obvious until I hit them:

- **Your CIMD URL has to be reachable.** I deployed behind Vercel's default deployment protection and the first call just failed. PostHog couldn't fetch the metadata document through the SSO gate. If registration never finishes, open the `.well-known` URL in an incognito window and make sure it loads.
- **Backdated events get dropped unless you ask for them.** I seed a week of demo pageviews so a new farm's dashboard isn't empty on day one, and they silently vanished until I set `historical_migration: true`. Current-timestamp events were fine; the old ones needed the flag.
