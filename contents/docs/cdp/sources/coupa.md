The Coupa connector syncs your spend data — invoices, purchase orders, requisitions, suppliers, contracts, expense reports, users, and approvals — into the PostHog data warehouse.

## Prerequisites

You need the following credentials from your Coupa instance:

- **Instance URL** – your Coupa host, e.g. `https://myorg.coupahost.com`
- **Client ID** and **Client secret** – from an OIDC client configured in your Coupa instance

A Coupa admin creates the OIDC client under **Setup > Integrations > OAuth2/OpenID Connect Clients**. Choose the **client credentials** grant type and assign read scopes for the objects you want to sync (e.g., `core.invoice.read`, `core.purchase_order.read`).

## Linking Coupa to PostHog

1. Go to the [Data pipeline page](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/sources) and the sources tab in PostHog.
2. Click **New source** and select **Coupa**.
3. Enter your **Instance URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client secret**.
4. Click **Next**, select the tables you want to sync, set the sync method and frequency, then click **Import**.

Once the syncs are complete, you can start using Coupa data in PostHog.

## Available tables

| Table | Description | Sync method |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `invoices` | Invoices in your Coupa account | Incremental |
| `purchase_orders` | Purchase orders | Incremental |
| `requisitions` | Requisitions (purchase requests) | Incremental |
| `suppliers` | Supplier records | Incremental |
| `contracts` | Contracts | Incremental |
| `expense_reports` | Expense reports | Incremental |
| `users` | Users in your Coupa account | Incremental |
| `approvals` | Approval records | Incremental |

All tables support **incremental** sync via the `updated_at` field. PostHog uses Coupa's server-side `updated_at[gt]` filter to sync only new or updated records on each run.
