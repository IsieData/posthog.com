This source is currently in **alpha**. The interface and available tables may change.

</CalloutBox>

The Apollo connector syncs your saved contacts, accounts, and opportunities from Apollo into PostHog.

## Adding a data source

1. Go to the [sources tab](https://app.posthog.com/data-management/sources) of the data pipeline section in PostHog.

2. Click **+ New source** and then click **Link** next to Apollo.

3. Get an API key from Apollo. In your Apollo account, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **API** and create a new API key. API access requires a paid Apollo plan.

4. Back in PostHog, paste the API key in the **API key** field and click **Next**.

5. Select the tables you want to sync, set the sync frequency, then click **Import**.

Once syncing completes, you can start using Apollo data in PostHog.

## Available tables

| Table           | Description                      | Sync method  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `contacts`      | Your saved contacts in Apollo    | Incremental  |
| `accounts`      | Your saved accounts in Apollo    | Incremental  |
| `opportunities` | Your opportunities (deals)       | Full refresh |

**Incremental** tables sync only records modified since the last sync, based on the `updated_at` field. **Full refresh** tables reload all data on each sync because Apollo's API doesn't support sorting opportunities by update time.

## Sync limitations

Apollo caps search results at 50,000 records per table (100 records × 500 pages). If a table exceeds this limit, older records beyond it won't sync.

For contacts and accounts using incremental sync, this cap is unlikely to cause issues because only new or changed records are fetched on subsequent syncs. It's most relevant on the very first full sync of a large dataset.

If the cap is reached during a sync, PostHog logs an error so the truncation is never silent.
